Goal:
Demonstrate that you understand the concepts of test driven design without having to rely to heavily on tools

Restrictions:
* Test drive your code
* One file only (pragmatic consideration to keep the interview time down)
* Standard java libraries only
* Write your own test functions

Requirements:
Prove that you can correctly implement a function where
* Input - a bunch of times, minutes and seconds, formatted as a single string like: "12:32 34:01 15:23 9:27 55:22 25:56"
* Output - the sum of the times, hours, minutes, and seconds, formatted as a single string like: "2:32:41"
