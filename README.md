#Interview Prep for CJ


##Rationale
This is to make your interview process less stressful by giving you an idea:

- what to expect from an interview
- what we are looking for, so you have a chance to decide if you are a good fit before coming in
- what skills will be tested, to help ensure you are ready for our coding exercise

##Sample Problems

- [time string](src/main/java/com/cj/interview/prep/TimeStringApplication.java)
- [date range](src/main/java/com/cj/interview/prep/DateRangeApplication.java)
- You should be able to complete each of these problems within an hour
- Do not over-complicate your solution, write only what you need to meet the goal
- Feel free to use these problems as preparation
- You will be given different problems of similar complexity during the interview
